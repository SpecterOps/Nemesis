YARA rule files in this directory must use a .yar or .yara extension to be
loaded by the engine. The example rules are distributed as .txt files and
must be renamed before they will be picked up.

You must also uncomment the volume mount in compose.yaml for the
file-enrichment service to mount this directory into the container.
