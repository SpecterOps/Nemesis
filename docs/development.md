# Dev Software Requirements

**The following requirements need to be installed for development:**

<details>
<summary>
Install the Protobuf Compiler
</summary>

**Purpose:** Compiles protobuf specs to python (or other languages).

* Install protobuf-compiler package
```bash
# Install the protobuf compiler
wget https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/download/v21.5/protoc-21.5-linux-x86_64.zip
sudo apt-get install -y zip
sudo unzip protoc-21.5-linux-x86_64.zip -d /usr/local/
```
</details>

**Also ensure you have minikube and skaffold setup from the [setup](./setup.md) guide.**

# Running Nemesis during Dev

If you're doing general development, if you set the **operation.environment** variable in [values.yaml](../helm/nemesis/values.yaml) to *test* which will deploy everything without persistent storage. Then running `skaffold dev -m nemesis` will build the images and kick everything off.

If you want to perform remote debugging for the `enrichment` container (see [remote_debugging.md](remote_debugging.md)) set the **operation.environment** variable in [values.yaml](../helm/nemesis/values.yaml) to *development* for the Helm chart which will deploy everything but the `enrichment` container without persistent storage. Run `skaffold dev -m nemesis` (or `helm install nemesis ./helm/nemesis --timeout '45m'` to use the public images) and then launching `skaffold dev -m enrichment` via VS Code will kick off the separate chart for just the enrichment container.

# Service Development

The recommended way to develop a new (or modify a current) service is with VS Code
and a remote workspace. This allows you to write and debug code without having to
deploy the complete container.

To do this, [follow this guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh) to
set up remote SSH for development - we recommend having the code itself reside
on a supported Debian 11 image and remoting in from your main OS for development.
If you have issues, see the [remote debugging guide](./remote_debugging.md) for more details.

Once the remote session has been established:

- Open up **just** the module folder in ./cmd/ (e.g., `enrichment`)
- Go to `Terminal` -> `New Terminal`
- (First time) activate the Poetry environment with `poetry install`
- Ensure a `./vscode/launch.json` is present (see ./cmd/enrichment for an example)
- Create a `.env` file in the root directory that contains VAR=val environment variables to set
- Start the needed Nemesis infrastructure on the host, minus this module.
  - Ensure the needed ports (RabbitMQ/etc.) are exposed locally
- On the left click the `Run and Debug` button and launch the application

**Note:** If you want to reset your Poetry environment, [see this post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/70064450).


# Building and Troubleshooting Docker Images
You can build and troubleshoot Nemesis's docker containers using the docker CLI. For example, to troublehshoot the enrichment image you can do the following:

1. Build the image and give it a name of "test"
```bash
docker build -t test -f ./dockerfiles/enrichment.Dockerfile
```

2. Run the "test" image and do your troubleshooting via a bash prompt:
```bash
docker run --rm -ti test bash
```

To build the images inside of k8s, you can use skaffold:
```bash
skaffold build
```

# Testing file processing
One can test file processing using the `./scripts/submit_to_nemesis.sh` script. To configure the script, modify the settings in `./cmd/enrichment/enrichment/cli/submit_to_nemesis/submit_to_nemesis.yaml`.

The `./sample_files/` folder contains many examples of files that Nemesis can process. For example, to test Nemesis's ability to extract a .ZIP file and process all the files inside of the zip, configure the YAML file and then run (make sure to specify the absolute path):
```bash

./scripts/submit_to_nemesis.sh -f ./sample_files/zip_test.zip
```

To see a list of all command line arguments run `./scripts/submit_to_nemesis.sh -h`.

# kubectl / kubernetes version skews

According to [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/releases/version-skew-policy/#kubectl) it's the best practice to keep kubectl and the kubernetes image used by minikube in sync. You can tell the versions of both with:

```bash
kubectl version --short
Flag --short has been deprecated, and will be removed in the future. The --short output will become the default.
Client Version: v1.27.1
Kustomize Version: v5.0.1
Server Version: v1.24.3
WARNING: version difference between client (1.27) and server (1.24) exceeds the supported minor version skew of +/-1
```

You can update kubectl with:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y kubectl
```

If you want to specify a version for kubectl, use:
```bash
curl -LO https://dl.k8s.io/release/v1.25.4/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
sudo install -o root -g root -m 0755 kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
```

You can then specify the kubernetes imge pulled by minikube with:
```bash
minikube start --kubernetes-version v1.25.4
```

# ./scripts/

The following describes the files in the ./scripts/ directory:

| File                  | Purpose                                                                     |
