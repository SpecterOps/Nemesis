# Overview

Nemesis is an offensive data enrichment pipeline and operator support system.

Built on Kubernetes with scale in mind, our goal with Nemesis was to create a centralized data processing platform that ingests data produced during offensive security assessments.

Nemesis aims to automate a number of repetitive tasks operators encounter on engagements, empower operators’ analytic capabilities and collective knowledge, and create structured and unstructured data stores of as much operational data as possible to help guide future research and facilitate offensive data analysis.

# Setup / Installation
See the [setup instructions](setup.md).

# Usage
See the [Nemesis Usage Guide](usage_guide.md).

# Contributing / Development Environment Setup
See [development.md](development.md)
